# driving-school

Our project is a virtual reality driving school simulation game. The game will simulate driving a car and incorporate real-world driving elements - roads, lanes, traffic signs, pedestrians, other vehicles, etc. The project aims to teach people learning to drive and help them prepare for driving lessons and practical tests - without leaving the house!
